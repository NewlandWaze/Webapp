Student Login system
This web application is designed as a simple user authentication system with the following key components:

Login Page: The application provides an entry point for existing users to log in. Users are required to enter their username and password to access their accounts. If the provided credentials match those stored in the application, users are redirected to the home page.

Registration Page: New users who don't have an account can register on this page. During registration, they need to provide essential details, including a unique username and password. Additionally, users may input optional information such as their full name, phone number, email, date of birth, location, nationality, and gender, depending on your specific requirements.

Home Page: Upon successfully logging in, users are redirected to the home page. The home page welcomes users with a personalized message, displaying their full name. This page serves as the main dashboard or landing page for authenticated users.

User Data Storage: User data, comprising usernames, passwords, and optional full names and additional details, is stored in a data store. In this case, local storage is utilized to store and manage user data. This storage enables the retrieval and verification of user information during login and registration processes.

User Authentication: The web application ensures secure authentication of users during login. It validates entered credentials (username and password) by comparing them with the stored user data. If the credentials match, the user is granted access; otherwise, they receive an error message.

User Registration: New users register by providing their personal information on the registration page. The application securely stores this information, typically encrypting passwords to enhance security. The user data is associated with their unique username.

Navigation and Menu: A user-friendly menu or navigation bar is included in the application. It offers options such as "Log out" and "Register" to assist users in navigating the application seamlessly.

User Experience: The application prioritizes providing a smooth and user-friendly experience for both registration and login processes. It features error message displays for invalid input and seamless redirection upon successful login.

Overall, this web application offers a basic yet functional user authentication and registration system. It empowers users to access personalized content on the home page once they have successfully logged in. As you continue to develop your application, consider expanding its functionality, enhancing security measures, and incorporating additional features related to user management and interaction.
